        "      - Open-source & widely supported\n",
        "    - Why is Python Popular?\n",
        "      - Simple & beginner-friendly\n",
        "      - Wide range of applications\n",
        "      - Strong community support\n",

        "      - Adopted by top companies\n",
        "      - Flexible & integrates well\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "    - Definition: Executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine instructions.\n",
        "    - Key Features:\n",
        "      1. Runs code immediately (good for debugging).\n",
        "      2. Supports interactive mode (>>>).\n",
        "      3. Works on all platforms.\n",
        "      4. Has different implementations:\n",
        "         - CPython (default)\n",
        "         - PyPy (faster, JIT)\n",
        "         - Jython (Java-based)\n",
        "         - IronPython (.NET-based)\n",
        "   - In short: The Python interpreter is the engine that reads and executes code directly, making Python easy, flexible, and powerful.\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   - Definition:\n",
        "     Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meaning. They are part of Python’s syntax and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers.\n",
        "   - Examples:\n",
        "   if, else, while, for, class, def, try, True, False, None, import, with, return, break, continue, etc.\n",
        "   - Key Points:\n",
        "      - They are case-sensitive (True ≠ true).\n",
        "      - Defined by Python itself — you cannot create your own keywords.\n",
        "      - The number of keywords may change slightly with different Python versions (e.g., Python 3.10 vs 3.12).\n",
        "   - In short: Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that the language uses for its commands and structure, so you can’t use them as names for your own variables or functions.\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - No ❌ — keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "   - Why?\n",
        "      - Keywords are reserved words that Python uses to define its syntax and rules (e.g., if, class, for).\n",
        "      - If you try to use them as variable names, Python gets confused because it expects them to perform their special function.\n",
        "    - In short: Keywords are reserved by Python, so they cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "5.  What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "     - Mutability means whether the value of an object can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "     - Mutable Objects (can be changed in place):\n",
        "        - Examples: list, dict, set, bytearray\n",
        "        - You can modify, add, or remove elements without creating a new object.\n",
        "\n",
        "           - nums = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "             nums.append(4)   # ✅ List changed in place\n",
        "\n",
        "             print(nums)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "    -  Mutable → Can be modified after creation.\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "    - Why Lists are Mutable\n",
        "         - Design choice: Lists are meant for dynamic collections of items.\n",
        "         - You often need to add, remove, or update elements.\n",
        "         - Example -\n",
        "\n",
        "         nums = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "         nums[0] = 100   # ✅ Modified in place\n",
        "\n",
        "         print(nums)  # [100, 2, 3]\n",
        "    - Why Tuples are Immutable\n",
        "         - Stability & safety: Tuples are used when you want a fixed set of values that should not change.\n",
        "         - This makes them hashable (can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets, unlike lists).\n",
        "         - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "         data = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "\n",
        "         data[0] = 100   # ❌ Error: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
        "    - In Short\n",
        "         - Lists are mutable → flexible, good for changing data.\n",
        "         - Tuples are immutable → stable, safe, and hashable (good for fixed data).\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
