        "      - Flexible & integrates well\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "    - Definition: Executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine instructions.\n",
        "    - Key Features:\n",
        "      1. Runs code immediately (good for debugging).\n",
        "      2. Supports interactive mode (>>>).\n",
        "      3. Works on all platforms.\n",
        "      4. Has different implementations:\n",
        "         - CPython (default)\n",
        "         - PyPy (faster, JIT)\n",
        "         - Jython (Java-based)\n",
        "         - IronPython (.NET-based)\n",
        "   - In short: The Python interpreter is the engine that reads and executes code directly, making Python easy, flexible, and powerful.\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   - Definition:\n",
        "     Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meaning. They are part of Python’s syntax and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers.\n",
        "   - Examples:\n",
        "   if, else, while, for, class, def, try, True, False, None, import, with, return, break, continue, etc.\n",
        "   - Key Points:\n",
        "      - They are case-sensitive (True ≠ true).\n",
        "      - Defined by Python itself — you cannot create your own keywords.\n",
        "      - The number of keywords may change slightly with different Python versions (e.g., Python 3.10 vs 3.12).\n",
        "   - In short: Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that the language uses for its commands and structure, so you can’t use them as names for your own variables or functions.\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - No ❌ — keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "   - Why?\n",
        "      - Keywords are reserved words that Python uses to define its syntax and rules (e.g., if, class, for).\n",
        "      - If you try to use them as variable names, Python gets confused because it expects them to perform their special function.\n",
        "    - In short: Keywords are reserved by Python, so they cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "5.  What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "     - Mutability means whether the value of an object can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "     - Mutable Objects (can be changed in place):\n",
        "        - Examples: list, dict, set, bytearray\n",
        "        - You can modify, add, or remove elements without creating a new object.\n",
        "\n",
        "              nums = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "              nums.append(4)   # ✅ List changed in place\n",
        "              print(nums)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "\n",
        "    -  Mutable → Can be modified after creation.\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "    - Why Lists are Mutable\n",
        "         - Design choice: Lists are meant for dynamic collections of items.\n",
        "         - You often need to add, remove, or update elements.\n",
        "         - Example -\n",
        "\n",
        "               nums = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "               nums[0] = 100   # ✅ Modified in place\n",
        "               print(nums)  # [100, 2, 3]\n",
        "    - Why Tuples are Immutable\n",
        "         - Stability & safety: Tuples are used when you want a fixed set of values that should not change.\n",
        "         - This makes them hashable (can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets, unlike lists).\n",
        "         - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "               data = (1, 2, 3)\n",
        "               data[0] = 100   # ❌ Error: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
        "    - In Short\n",
        "         - Lists are mutable → flexible, good for changing data.\n",
        "         - Tuples are immutable → stable, safe, and hashable (good for fixed data).\n",

        "                 print(not(x > 2 and x < 10))  # False (because the condition is True, but 'not' flips it)\n",

        "         - Done automatically by Python.\n",
        "         - Happens when Python converts one data type into another without the programmer asking for it, usually during arithmetic operations.\n",

        "              print(type(result))  # <class 'float'>\n",
        "         Here, Python automatically promotes int to float to avoid losing decimal precision.\n",

        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    - Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions and execute different code paths depending on whether a condition (expression) is True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "    In other words, they give your program the ability to control the flow instead of just running line by line\n",
        "    - Why are they useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "         - To check conditions (e.g., if a number is positive or negative).\n",
        "         - To handle different scenarios (e.g., login success vs. failure).\n",
        "         - To avoid unnecessary execution of code.\n",

        "         1. if statement – runs a block of code if the condition is true.\n",

        "         4. Nested if statements – conditions inside other conditions.\n",

        "\n",

        "    - The elif statement (short for else if) lets you check multiple conditions in sequence.\n",
        "    - Execution flow:\n",
        "       1. Python checks the first if condition.\n",
        "       2. If it’s False, it moves to the next elif.\n",
        "       3. The first condition that is True will execute its block, and the rest are skipped.\n",

        "    - Example\n",
